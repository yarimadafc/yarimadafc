/**
 * Rewrite project-relative script paths for the plugin subtree (issue #523).
 *
 * The ./plugin subtree is a verbatim copy of the dist/claude-code output,
 * where {{scripts_path}} resolves to `.claude/skills/impeccable/scripts`,
 * a path relative to the user's project. Run from the plugin cache, that
 * path points at whatever the project has installed: a plugin-only user
 * gets MODULE_NOT_FOUND, and a dual-install user silently runs the
 * project's (possibly older) skill copy.
 *
 * No literal path survives installation (the plugin cache location varies
 * per machine and per plugin version), so the plugin SKILL.md uses
 * ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR} (issue #744): the directory containing SKILL.md,
 * substituted by Claude Code at load time. Source uses `<skill-base-dir>`;
 * the rewrite maps it to the host variable only in SKILL.md. References
 * arrive through ordinary file reads and retain the explicit placeholder;
 * CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR is not an exported shell variable. Agent files cannot use either
 * token (a spawned agent never loads SKILL.md) and get the
 * ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} variable instead; see PLUGIN_AGENT_SCRIPTS_PATH.
