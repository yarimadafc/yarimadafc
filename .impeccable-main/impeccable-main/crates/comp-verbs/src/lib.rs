//! impeccable-comp-verbs: the four comp-fidelity verb orchestrators
//! (`comp-spec`, `comp-diff`, `font-match`, `build-phase`), ported from the
//! skill's JS scripts of the same name.
//!
//! OPEN and free of the closed `core` crate. It wires only the pure `comp`
//! foundation plus `common` (`Io`). Two things it cannot do on its own are
//! injected by the CLI so the browser (and its `core` dependency) stays out:
//!
//!   - font-match's headless rendering of font specimens: a [`font_match::FontRenderer`].
//!   - build-phase's organic-clip-path CSS scan (a rule that lives in `core`):
//!     a [`build_phase::OrganicScan`] closure.
//!
//! The font-index catalog is resolved at run time the way concept-seed resolves
//! its catalog (`IMPECCABLE_CATALOG_DIR`, then the skill's shipped copy); it is
//! never committed to the engine repo. See [`font_match`].
