//! impeccable-foundation: the helper layer of the impeccable engine. It carries
//! the JS runtime semantics the port depends on (number and string
//! formatting, trig, regex fragments), colour maths, the rule registry,
//! inline-ignore handling, page and font helpers, the DOM probe trait with
//! its snapshot implementation and selector engine, the plain-data types
//! every rule check takes in and hands back, and the rule-pack extension
//! point downstream crates add rules through.
//!
//! What is NOT here is the rule logic: the `check_*` and `scan_*` functions
//! and their heuristics live in `impeccable-core`. This crate has no
//! filesystem, process, or network access; it compiles to wasm.
