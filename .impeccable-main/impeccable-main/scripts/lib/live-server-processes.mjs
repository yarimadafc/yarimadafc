/**
 * Finding and killing live servers a test run left behind.
 *
 * The harness starts live servers in two shapes and neither one dies with the
 * process that started it:
 *
 *   1. a direct child (`node skill/scripts/live-server.mjs --port=N`, or
 *      `$IMPECCABLE_BIN live-server --port=N` once the engine is Rust), stopped
 *      by an HTTP `/stop` call in an `after()` hook;
 *   2. a detached daemon (`live-server --background`, or a full `live` boot),
 *      which is orphaned to pid 1 by design and stopped by the `stop` verb.
 *
 * Both survive a runner that dies before teardown: a `SIGKILL`, a Ctrl-C, a
 * `node:test` timeout that skips the `after()` hook. This module is the safety
 * net. It identifies servers by an environment marker the runner exports, so a
 * sweep can only ever match a server this repo's test harness started; nothing
 * is matched by port, by name alone, or by "looks like impeccable".
 *
 * Every marker value is an opaque token: a random run or process id, or a hash
 * of the checkout path. None of them is a path, and none can contain
 * whitespace, which is what keeps the `ps -E` matching below exact.
